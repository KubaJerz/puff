1. This is the regime that we will use to hyper-paramer search and fine tune the model
    It is sa 60/20/20 split across participents

    1.1
        This is where we take 60/20/20 from the each participte then append to the 60 to train and 20 to dev then the last 20is test
        This is how we eval customization


2. This is the type of split as one but we now ranodmly do it 30 times and then will eval in the aggregate

    2.1 This is the same idea as 1.1


3. We split uo the sata across recordings

4. the self-supervised regime (see paper for details)
